<h3>
DOVE COTTAGE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
This was the home of Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy from December
1799 to May 1808.  When Wordsworth left the cottage for two months in
1802 on the occasion of his honeymoon he wrote "A Farewell," which
begins:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
"Farewell, thou little nook of mountain ground,<br />
Thou rocky corner in the lowest stair<br />
Of that magnificent temple which doth bound<br />
One side of our whole vale with grandeur rare;<br />
Sweet garden-orchard, eminently fair,<br />
The lovliest spot that man hath ever found,<br />
Farewell!&mdash;we leave thee to Heaven's peaceful care,<br />
Thee, and the Cottage which thou dost surround.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="intro">
De Quincey also lived at Dove Cottage from 1809-1816.  He has described
it as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Let the cottage be a real cottage, in fact (for I must abide by the
actual scene), a white cottage, embowered with flowering shrubs, so
chosen as to unfold a succession of flowers upon the walls, and
clustering round the windows through all months of spring, summer, and
autumn&mdash;beginning, in fact, with May roses, and ending with jasmine.

<h3>
GRASMERE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
There are many descriptions in Dorothy Wordsworth's journal of Grasmere
and Rydal Waters of which the following extracts are typical:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
SATURDAY, 26th (December 1801)....
</p>

<p>
We walked to Rydale.  Grasmere Lake a beautiful image of stillness,
clear as glass, reflecting all things.  The wind was up, and the waters
sounding.  The lake of a rich purple, the fields a soft yellow, the
island yellowish-green, the copses red-brown, the mountains purple, the
church and buildings how quiet they were!
</p>

<p>
Sunday, 31st (January 1802)....  We walked round the two lakes.
Grasmere was very soft, and Rydale was extremely beautiful from the
western side.  Nab Scar was just topped by a cloud which, cutting it
off as high as it could be cut off, made the mountain look uncommonly
lofty.  We sate down a long time with different plans.  I always love
to walk that way, because it is the way I first came to Rydale and
Grasmere, and because our dear Coleridge did also.  When I came with
Wm., 6 and ½ years ago, it was just at sunset.  There was a rich yellow
light on the waters, and the islands were reflected there.  To-day it
was grave and soft but not perfectly calm.

GRASMERE CHURCH
</h3>

<p class="intro">
In the churchyard are the graves of Wordsworth, his wife, son,
daughter, and two children who died in infancy, as well as of his
sister Dorothy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
The old rude church, with bare, bald tower, is here;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath its shadow high-born Rotha flows;<br />
Rotha, remembering well who slumbers near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with cool murmur lulling his repose.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Rotha, remembering well who slumbers near.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hills, his lakes, his streams are with him yet.<br />
Surely the heart that reads her own heart clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature forgets not soon: 'tis we forget.<br />

A LAKELAND WALK<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
A gate swings to! our tide hath flow'd<br />
Already from the silent road.<br />
The valley-pastures, one by one,<br />
Are threaded, quiet in the sun;<br />
And now beyond the rude stone bridge<br />
Slopes gracious up the western ridge.<br />
Its woody border, and the last<br />
Of its dark upland farms is past&mdash;<br />
Cool farms, with open-lying stores,<br />
Under their burnish'd sycamores;<br />
All past! and through the trees we glide,<br />
Emerging on the green hill-side.<br />
There climbing hangs, a far-seen sign,<br />
Our wavering, many-colour'd line;<br />
There winds, upstreaming slowly still<br />
Over the summit of the hill<br />
And now, in front, behold outspread<br />
Those upper regions we must tread!<br />
Mid hollows, and clear heathy swells,<br />
The cheerful silence of the fells.<br />
Some two hours' march with serious air,<br />
Through the deep noontide heats we fare;<br />
The red-grouse, springing at our sound,<br />
Skims, now and then, the shining ground;<br />
No life, save his and ours, intrudes<br />
Upon these breathless solitudes.<br />

DUNGEON GHYLL FORCE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
This spot is the scene of the lamb's rescue described by Wordsworth in
the "Idle Shepherd-boys."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
It was a spot which you may see<br />
If ever you to Langdale go;<br />
Into a chasm a mighty block<br />
Hath fallen, and made a bridge of rock:<br />
The gulf is deep below;<br />
And, in a basin black and small,<br />
Receives a lofty waterfall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
With staff in hand across the cleft<br />
The challenger pursued his march;<br />
And now, all eyes and feet, hath gained<br />
The middle of the arch.<br />
When list! he hears a piteous moan&mdash;<br />
Again!&mdash;his heart within him dies&mdash;<br />
His pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,<br />
He totters, pallid as a ghost,<br />
And, looking down, espies<br />
A lamb, that in the pool is pent<br />
Within that black and frightful rent.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

When he had learnt what thing it was,<br />

MOUNTAIN TARNS
</h3>

<p class="poem">
There is a power to bless<br />
In hill-side loneliness,<br />

<h3>
BRANTWOOD
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Brantwood was the home of John Ruskin during the latter years of his
life.  Mr W. G. Collingwood in his life of Ruskin has described the
journey to Brantwood, as it was in Ruskin's time, as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
After changing and changing trains, and stopping at many a roadside
station, at last you see suddenly, over the wild undulating country,
the Coniston Old Man&mdash;maen, stone: a survival of Celtic Cumbria&mdash;and
its crags, abrupt on the left, and the lake, long and narrow, on the
right.  Across the water, tiny in the distance and quite alone amongst
forests and moors, there is Brantwood; and beyond it everything seems
uncultivated, uninhabited, except for one grey farmhouse high on the
fell, where gaps in the ragged larches show how bleak and storm-swept a
spot it is....  You drive up and down a narrow, hilly lane, catching
peeps of mountains and sunset through thick, overhanging trees; you
turn sharp up through a gate under dark firs and larches; and the
carriage stops in what seems in the twilight a sort of court&mdash;a
gravelled space, one side formed by a rough stone wall crowned with
laurels and almost precipitous coppice, the brant (or steep) wood
above, and the rest is Brantwood with a capital B.

<h3>
ULLSWATER
</h3>

<p class="intro">
On April 15th, 1802, Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited this
lake, and, near Gowbarrow Park, saw the daffodils which he has
described in the following poem, and she in her diary.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
A host of golden daffodils;<br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
And twinkle on the milky way,<br />
They stretched in never-ending line<br />
Along the margin of the bay:<br />
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
The waves beside them danced, but they<br />
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br />
A poet could not but be gay,<br />
In such a jocund company:<br />
I gazed&mdash;and gazed&mdash;but little thought<br />
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
They flash upon that inward eye<br />
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
And dances with the daffodils.<br />

<h3>
HELVELLYN
</h3>

<p class="intro">
In the spring of 1805 a gentleman perished by losing his way on
Helvellyn.  His remains were not discovered till three months
afterwards, when they were found guarded by his dog.  Sir W. Scott
visited the Lake District later on in the same year and composed the
following poem:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
I climb'd the dark brow of mighty Helvellyn,<br />
Lakes and mountains beneath me gleam'd misty and wide;<br />
All was still, save by fits, when the eagle was yelling,<br />
And starting around me the echoes replied.<br />
On the right, Striden-edge round the Red-tarn was bending,<br />
And Catchedicam its left verge was defending,<br />
One huge nameless rock in the front was ascending,<br />
When I mark'd the sad spot where the wanderer had died.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
Dark green was that spot 'mid the brown mountain-heather,<br />
Where the Pilgrim of Nature lay stretch'd in decay,<br />
Like the corpse of an outcast abandon'd to weather,<br />
Till the mountain winds wasted the tenantless clay.<br />
Not yet quite deserted, though lonely extended,<br />
For, faithful in death, his mute favourite attended,<br />
The much-loved remains of her master defended,<br />
And chased the hill-fox and the raven away.<br />
</p>

They seem to have been built for the human race, as at once their
schools and cathedrals; full of treasures of illuminated manuscript for
the scholar, kindly in simple lessons to the worker, quiet in pale
cloisters for the thinker, glorious in holiness for the worshipper.

Once more, O Derwent! to thy awful shores<br />
I come, insatiate of the accustomed sight,<br />

In all my wanderings still remembering thee.<br />

FRIAR'S CRAG
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The first thing which I remember, as an event in life, was being taken
by my nurse to the brow of Friar's Crag on Derwentwater; the intense
joy mingled with awe, that I had in looking through the hollows in the
mossy roots, over the crag, into the dark lake, has associated itself
more or less with all twining roots of trees ever since.

DERWENTWATER AND BASSENTHWAITE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Greta Hall, which was the residence of S. T. Coleridge from 1800 to
1804 and for a short time in 1806, as well as of R. Southey from Sept.
1803 to his death in March 1843, commands a view of both these lakes.
Coleridge in a letter to Southey from Greta Hall, dated 13th April
1801, describes the situation of the house as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
Behind the house is an orchard, and a small wood on a steep slope, at
the foot of which flows the river Greta, which winds round and catches
the evening lights in the front of the house.  In front we have a
giant's camp&mdash;an encamped army of tent-like mountains, which, by an
inverted arch, gives a view of another vale.  On our right the lovely
vale and the wedge-shaped lake of Bassenthwaite; and on our left
Derwentwater and Lodore in view, and the fantastic mountains of
Borrowdale.  Behind us the massy Skiddaw, smooth, green, high, with two
chasms and a tent-like ridge in the larger.  A fairer scene you have
not seen in all your wanderings.

There is a lake hid far among the hills,<br />

Not fed by gentle streams, or playful rills,<br />

There gleam no lovely hues of hanging wood,<br />
No spot of sunshine lights her sullen side;<br />
For horror shaped the wild in wrathful mood,<br />
And o'er the tempest heaved the mountains' pride.<br />

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
